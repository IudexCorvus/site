									<h1>Project 2</h1>
									<p>My CAD project</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I had a simple problem that I think alot of people have. My desk space is limited and the 2 major things where both
									 linked to my hobby. I have brushes and tools all over the place and the airbrush pump takes quite a space. 2 potential items came to mind: 
									 a wall mounted tool holder for tools, pencils, brushes and more and a "8" shaped sitting shelf for the airpump and transformer with hose and airbrush holder.
									</p> 

								<p>insert pic of desk</p> 
								<p>I started by going for the easyer of the 2 which was the 8 shaped shelf. I first made a rough sketch of the product.
									I then made a several mesurments of the transformer since it needs to fit neatly inside of the lower 8 hole and then the pump.
									Both have a powercord connecting them and to and outlet. since this will go to the corner of my desk I will need to have
							 		some leeway for the cord aswell as cut in to the shelf itself to go out. i kinda wanted to see if i chould close the backside 
									of the shelf but i will need a exit hole large enough for the cord. I also want the long side of the shelf to have hook for the hose and 
							 		airbrush holders for my airbrushes. theis need to be able to extend far enough for my hand to be able to conftroble place my airbrush 
									with the hose attachet on it and on just to </p>
								<p>insert pic of sketch</p> 
								<p>It will have a openable top to take the pump out and fitting it in its place and a hole in the shelf between for cable management.
									And after all that whent away as soon as I found out it was going over my alotted plywood (300x600).
									So I needed a alternitive, I had infact made a sideproject for a friend after a simple picture.</p>
								<p>insert pic of text</p> 
								<p>Looked simple enough, it wasnt. This became a 14 piece incased model stand.
									without all the minutiae the prosses is simple and easy to repeat.
