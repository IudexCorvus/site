									<h1>Project 2</h1>
									<p>My CAD project</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="luke.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I had a simple problem that I think alot of people have. My desk space is limited and the 2 major things where both
									 linked to my hobby. I have brushes and tools all over the place and the airbrush pump takes quite a space. 2 potential items came to mind: 
									 a wall mounted holder for tools, pencils, brushes and more and a "8" shaped sitting shelf for the airpump and transformer with hose and airbrush holder.
									</p> 

								<p>I started by going for the easyer of the 2 which was the 8 shaped shelf. I first made a rough sketch of the product.
									I then made a several mesurments of the transformer since it needs to fit neatly inside of the lower 8 hole and then the pump.
									Both have a powercord connecting them and to and outlet. since this will go to the corner of my desk I will need to have
							 		some leeway for the cord aswel2l as cut in to the shelf itself to go out. It will have a openable top to take the pump out and fitting it in its place and a hole in the shelf between for cable management.
								</p>
								<p>And after all that whent away as soon as I found out it was going over my alotted plywood (300x600).
									So I needed a alternitive, I had infact made a sideproject for a friend after a simple picture.</p>
								<p>insert pic of text</p> 
								<p>Looked simple enough, it wasnt. This became a 14 piece incased model stand.
									without all the minutiae the prosses is simple and easy to repeat.</p>

										<h3>Order of operation</h3>
										<ol>
											<li>Set every parameter you can</li>
											<li>Set a special kerf peramiter accounting for the diameter of the laser (0,015mm in my case)</li>
											<li>Make the intended product</li>
											<li>Lay it flat with either the align function or the nest function</li>
											<li>Make a single sketch of the entire product and use the offset function to account for kerf</li>
											<li>Export that sketch as a dxf file</li>
											<li>Open it in inkscape and set it up for cutting</li>
											<li>In case of duplication delete one of the dupes</li>
											<li>Make the line thickness 0.02mm in the outline setting</li>
											<li>Save the file as a pdf and optionaly add borders to it</li>
											<li>The laser cutter must by setup and set the start point</li>
											<li>Start cutting</li>
											<li>The components will need to be gently hammered into place and sand the corners</li>
											<li>Enjoy the product of your labor</li>

								<p>Its important to note that when a slot is cut for a insert the hole is not a perfect rectangle but a squircle and the insert will be a rectangle. 
									After assembly I note varius deffects in the product and found that there were mainly things that can be fixed, maximised even. I noticed then
									that there was a error in the size of certain points for ideal use. The walls werent straight, account for warping when cutting and in raw material
								and finaly try be more efficient with a 300 by 600 plank</p>
								<p>insert MK1 in use</p>
								
								<p>The next step is easy. Do it again, do it better. Stay tuned.</p>
							<p>The MK2 was a success but had it's own issues. The increase in step height made the size of the sides and had me going over the 300x600 plywood. I had made the the back
								of each step smaller to save on wood but it was not enough. I desided to remove the back of the piece as it was made to be used against a wall. I fixed the bad walls with 
								some better teeth location and the stepheight.</p>
							<p>The MK3 is going to be optimized for retail. the 50/50 split on stepdepth is not as retail friendy as simple steps and while in the Mk1 the first step was bigger then the rest 
								the first strep is unnecessary.  </p>
